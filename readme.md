# What is Amphora
Amphora was a product design by a graduating MBA student at UCSD that was looking for some help from the engineering dept. to provide computer simulations that would help inform design improvements. The basic idea of the Amphora product was to provide a natural amplication of cell phone speaker based on amphitheator design. 

## How is it modeled
The general idea of amphitheators is to use a parabolic shape to reflect sound originating from a point approximately at the parabola's focus. This is the same idea as satellites and those microphones you see being pointed at the players from the sidelines in football games, except for the fact that those products are meant to receive the sound/light at the focus. Thus, the central idea of the product was to provide a roughly parabolic capsule where the phones speaker would rest at approximately the focal point of the capsule. 

## The math involved
While I originally sought to rederive the math used, I quickly realized that the 10+ years that have passed since I originally solved this problem has made me *real* rusty at my math skills. While I still would like to rederive all of the math, it will have to wait until another day.


## What is my goal with this project
My goal with recreating this problem is simple.
1. I want to try out HTMX as a front end 'framework'
2. Explore OpenGL/WebGL implementations
3. I want a realistic project to learn/practice programming Golang
4. I want a problem that is resource intensive so that I can explore low-level techniques to produce more performance
5. I want a base problem that I can use to try and learn different languages and compare performance

### What are some ideas that I have to increase performance when running with Golang
1. Use of channels
2. Better management of memory
3. Streaming/Batching results

### Other languages that I may explore useing
1. Zig
2. OCaml
3. Rust
